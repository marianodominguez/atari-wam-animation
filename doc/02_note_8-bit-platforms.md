# A note about other 8-bit platforms:

Along with the Atari, I've considered writing a WAM player for other platforms like the Commodore 64 and the Apple IIe.  Both of these use a version of the 6502 CPU, so the machine language portion of the program should be very similar.  However, the CPU in the "vanilla" version of these machines (no add-ons) only runs at 1.0 MHz, compared to 1.8 MHz for the Atari.  Also, neither machine has Atari's 160x96 graphics mode (Commodore's closest is 160x200, and Apple has only 80x48 or 280x192).  These are fatal blows for the WAM player, since Atari's 160x96 graphics and 1.8 MHz CPU speed are just the right combination to allow reasonably detailed animations to play at the minimum acceptable speed of 12 FPS (frames per second).  I would guess, for example, that Commodore's 160x200 screen would take 50% longer to draw a frame (assuming that about half the lines would double in length), and with the CPU being slightly more than half the Atari's speed, frames would take 2.7 times as long to draw.  I've noticed that the Atari maxes out at about 200 bytes per frame for 12 FPS, so the Commodore would only be able to handle about 75 bytes per frame at 12 FPS.  That's fast enough to play a very simple animation like "boxes.awm", but not nearly fast enough to play "car.awm" or "ned.awm" at the minimum speed.  An animation like "balls.awm" (400 bytes per frame) would be out of the question...
